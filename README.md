**CramSmart**

CramSmart is an AI-powered study app designed to help students learn more effectively through interactive modes like flashcards, quizzes, spaced repetition, and speaking exercises. The platform makes studying engaging, personalized, and impactful, empowering learners to build confidence and retain knowledge efficiently.

**Motivation**

I created CramSmart from my own experience struggling with challenging subjects like math and science. I wanted a tool that made learning interactive and adaptable to each studentâ€™s needs. The goal was simple: help students practice, test themselves, and gain confidence through multiple study modes, all in one place.

**Features**

Multiple Learning Modes: Study through flashcards, quizzes, exams, or speaking exercises.

Spaced Repetition: Reinforce memory retention and review content efficiently.

Interactive AI Assistance: Generate notes, quizzes, and mock exams for personalized practice.

User Progress Tracking: Track performance and mastery across topics over time.

**Challenges & Lessons Learned**

Building CramSmart was a journey full of hurdles. I struggled to understand new technologies, research and design an intuitive user flow, and figure out what features would truly help students learn. After publishing the app, I realized I needed real feedback, which meant marketing it across campus and encouraging students to try it and share honest thoughts. Iterating based on that feedback taught me persistence, empathy for users, and the importance of designing with real learners in mind. Today, seeing students use CramSmart and grow through it reminds me why tackling hard problems to create meaningful impact is worth every challenge.
