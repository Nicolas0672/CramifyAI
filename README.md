Motivation

I created CramSmart from my own experience struggling to study challenging subjects like math and science. I wanted a tool that made learning interactive, engaging, and adaptable to each studentâ€™s needs. The goal is to empower learners to practice, test themselves, and gain confidence through multiple study modes.

Features

Multiple Learning Modes: Users can study through flashcards, quizzes, exams, or by speaking about topics aloud.

Spaced Repetition: Reinforces memory retention and helps users review content efficiently.

Interactive AI Assistance: Generates notes, quizzes, and mock exams to personalize learning.

User Progress Tracking: Track performance and mastery across topics over time.

Challenges

Building CramSmart was a journey with many hurdles:

Learning new technologies and understanding how to structure the app efficiently.

Designing a smooth, intuitive user flow and figuring out what features would be most helpful.

Marketing the app across campus to get meaningful user feedback for iteration.

Iterating features based on feedback to make the app more user-friendly and engaging.

These challenges taught me persistence, empathy for users, and the importance of designing with real learners in mind.
