## 🧠 Challenges & Lessons Learned

Building CramSmart was a journey full of growth.  
Throughout development, I had to:

- Learn unfamiliar technologies from scratch  
- Understand real study pain points  
- Design a user flow that felt intuitive and supportive  
- Gather honest, meaningful feedback by sharing the app across campus  

Iterating based on real student feedback taught me persistence, empathy, and the value of designing *with* students—not just for them.

Seeing learners use CramSmart today reminds me that tackling hard problems to create meaningful impact is always worth it. 💛
